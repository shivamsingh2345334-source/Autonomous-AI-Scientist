## 📊 Example Output

Below is an example output generated by the Autonomous Experiment Engine
for a synthetic medicine efficacy experiment.

### 🔬 Experiment
Create a dataset of 5 potential medicine compounds with random efficacy scores (0–100)
and visualize them using a bar chart.

### 📋 Generated Dataset

 Compound  Efficacy Score

0 Compound A 44
1 Compound B 47
2 Compound C 64
3 Compound D 67
4 Compound E 67


### 📈 Visualization
A bar chart is automatically generated using matplotlib,
showing comparative efficacy scores for each compound.

This demonstrates the system’s ability to:
- Autonomously generate synthetic data
- Execute Python code safely
- Produce analytical outputs and visualizations without human intervention
