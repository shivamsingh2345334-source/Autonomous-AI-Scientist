## 🏗️ System Architecture — Research Paper Search Tool

### 📌 Overview

This system is a simple research assistant pipeline that:

* Collects a research topic from the user
* Authenticates with Groq API
* Searches arXiv for relevant papers
* Retrieves paper titles and summaries
* Displays results in the terminal
