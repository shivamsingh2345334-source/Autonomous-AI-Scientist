# Day 2 Architecture – Autonomous Research Scientist

## Objective
Transform the AI from a paper-search assistant into an autonomous scientific thinker.

## Core Components

1. Planner Agent
   - Generates original hypotheses
   - Designs experimental plans

2. Critic Agent
   - Acts as a peer reviewer
   - Identifies flaws and risks

3. Refinement Agent
   - Produces publication-grade research plans

4. Memory Layer (ChromaDB)
   - Stores refined research outputs
   - Enables long-term research continuity

## Data Flow
User Input → Planner → Critic → Refinement → Persistent Memory
