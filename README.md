# 🧠 Autonomous AI Researcher — One-Man AGI Research Lab

> “Ek aisa AI Scientist jo khud papers padhe, hypothesis banaye, experiment design kare, code likhe, results analyze kare aur next research direction suggest kare — fully autonomous.”

---

## 🚀 Overview

Autonomous AI Researcher ek advanced multi-agent research system hai jo end-to-end scientific research workflow automate karta hai.
Yeh system ek virtual research lab ki tarah kaam karta hai jahan AI khud knowledge gather karta hai, reasoning karta hai aur continuously improve hota rehta hai.

Is project ka vision hai future ke AI Scientists banana — jahan ek single intelligent system poora R&D lifecycle handle kare.

## 🎯 Core Idea

AI system jo:

* 📚 Research papers khud read kare (ArXiv retrieval)
* 🧪 Hypothesis generate kare
* ⚙️ Experiments design kare
* 💻 Python code likhe aur run kare
* 📊 Results analyze kare (statistics + visualization)
* 🔁 Next experiment suggest kare (self-improving loop)

## 🔄 Autonomous Research Workflow

1. Topic input diya jata hai
2. AI relevant research papers fetch karta hai
3. Hypothesis + experiment plan generate hota hai
4. AI khud Python code likhkar experiment run karta hai
5. Statistical analysis se results validate hote hain
6. Critic agent flaws identify karta hai
7. Final refined research direction propose hoti hai

Ye pura loop automatically repeat hota hai until optimal insight mil jaye.


## ▶️ Usage

```bash
python main.py --topic "Carbon Capture using Graphene Materials"
```

Output:

* Generated hypothesis
* Experiment code
* Analysis dashboard
* Next research suggestion

## 🧠 Why This Project Matters

Traditional research slow hoti hai:

* Manual paper reading
* Trial-error experiments
* Disconnected analysis pipelines

Ye system weeks ki research ko minutes me compress karta hai by automating:
Reasoning → Experimentation → Validation → Iteration
