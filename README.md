# Autonomous AI Scientist 🧠🤖

Day-1 Prototype of an AI Scientist that:
- Accepts a research topic
- Searches Arxiv papers automatically
- Prepares structured research inputs

## Day-1 Features
- Secure Groq API connection
- Live Arxiv paper retrieval
- Clean & minimal research pipeline

## How to Run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python src/day1_entry.py
Vision

This project will evolve into a fully autonomous research scientist capable of:

Reading papers

Forming hypotheses

Designing experiments

Publishing insights

🔬 Autonomous AI Scientist
Day-2: Self-Critiquing Research Intelligence
🚀 What Changed in Day-2?

Day-2 introduces a true Autonomous Research Agent that can:

Generate a novel research hypothesis

Critically review its own idea (like a senior scientist)

Refine the plan into an execution-ready research proposal

Persist research memory using a vector database

This transforms the system from a paper fetcher (Day-1) into a thinking scientific entity.

🧠 Core Capability Added (Day-2)
Capability	Description
🧪 Planner	Proposes original hypotheses + experiments
🧐 Critic	Identifies logical, technical, and scientific flaws
🛠 Refiner	Produces a corrected, execution-ready plan
🧠 Memory	Stores refined research using ChromaDB

⚠️ This is not prompt chaining.
This is a closed-loop reasoning system with memory.
