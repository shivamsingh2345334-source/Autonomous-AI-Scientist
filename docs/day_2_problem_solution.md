# Day 2 – Problem & Solution

## Problem
LLMs generate research ideas but fail to:
- Self-criticize
- Improve scientific rigor
- Retain long-term research memory

## Solution
An autonomous research loop that:
- Generates hypotheses
- Critiques its own logic
- Refines outputs like a senior scientist
- Stores results in vector memory

## Outcome
A self-improving AI research scientist capable of independent reasoning.
