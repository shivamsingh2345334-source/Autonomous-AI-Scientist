# Problem Statement

LLMs can generate code but lack:
- Safe execution
- Autonomous retry
- Error feedback loops

Manual debugging breaks true autonomy.


# Solution Overview

This system enables:
- Autonomous code generation
- Safe execution
- Self-healing retries
- Research-grade experiment automation
