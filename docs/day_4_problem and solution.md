# 🧪 Problem Statement

Drug discovery pipelines generate multiple experimental compounds.
However, selecting the most promising candidate requires
statistical validation rather than intuition.

Manual analysis is:
- Error-prone
- Time-consuming
- Not scalable



# ✅ Solution Overview

The AI Statistical Analyst Agent:
- Performs hypothesis testing (one-sample t-test)
- Validates efficacy against a baseline
- Identifies statistically significant compounds
- Generates interactive dashboards for decision-makers

This ensures **data-driven R&D decisions**.
